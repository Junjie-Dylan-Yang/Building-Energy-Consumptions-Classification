# Building Energy Consumptions Classification

With the trending spirit of energy saving all over the world, commercial buildings especially skyscrapers in major cities are looking for possible solutions to reduce energy cost for heating and cooling. To encourage investing and understanding in these solutions, it is desirable to investigate energy consumption patterns.

The primary goal of this project will be to construct and evaluate an appropriate model to predict metered building energy usage in areas of chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters, based on different physical features of a building along with basic measurements of the surrounding weather. 

Aside from making predictions, there are several other questions we will explore associated with characterizing energy consumption. One of them will be to determine which factors influence or are associated with increases in energy consumption and quantifying this relationship. A specific example, for instance, would be characterizing the effect of temperature on energy consumption.
